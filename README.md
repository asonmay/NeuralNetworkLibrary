# Neural Network Library

This is a library of my implimentation of neural network related data structures and algorithms. 
I made this during a neural network class taken in high school, and everything was made from scratch.

Here is a list of everything in the library:
- Neural Network class
  - Neuron class
  - Dendrite class
  - Layer class
- Perceptron class
- Error and Activation Functions
- A genetic trainer class that can train a population of neural networks.
- Deep learning algorithms such as Gradient Descent.
- A Monte Carlo Tree with search algorithms and functions to get best move
